I've used Elastic on a few projects, leveraging both the logging and analysis 
capabilities of various beats implementations (FileBeat, MetricBeat, Kibana) and
the search engine capabilities of the search API. I've built faceted search clients
to utilize elastic aggregations to build extremely powerful search tools.
