Simulao is a project that arose from a need to test applications
that relied on a series of events received in real-time.
Simulao makes it easier for both developers and non-developers alike
to create and execute test scenarios for systems.

The idea driving the creation of Simulao was to limit the number of
times a developer compiles and deploys an updated testing solution.
Simulao abstracts the process of writing these real-time messaging
tests into a non-technical repeatable process.


Using Simulao, anyone can create a series of schemas and scenarios that 
can be used for a number of testing areas including integration, regression 
and unit testing.
