Road2Glory is a personal project of mine to develop a Fantasy Football 
web application. My league wanted to implement a series of rules that
were not natively supported by the larger fantasy football applications
that existed at the time (ESPN, Yahoo, etc.). Ultimately, it was too large
a task for only myself and ultimately became a sandbox environment.

This sandbox environment provided me with a real-life scenario to play with 
new technologies, methodologies and patterns I learned both professionally 
and in college. It started with an application to learn the Laravel framework,
and continued to provide the testing grounds for the microservice and event-driven
design patterns.

I revisit the project from time to time looking for ways I could potentially 
optimize certain procedures and create smaller libraries that others might
be interested in using. Ultimately, this process led to an employment opportunity
when someone ran across some of that code (see Trivera Experience)
