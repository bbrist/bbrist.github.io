I grew up in Oregon, went to school in Wyoming, and have thus far spent my
professional career in the Washington D.C/Baltimore area. I enjoy a challenge,
wherever one may present itself, and am very competitive. I am very goal-oriented, 
and I value working in a good team over the nature of the work.
