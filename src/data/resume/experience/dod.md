I spent several years working as an intern performing a variety of duties for a Department of Defense entity.
My work included the following roles:
- Web Development
- Protocol Analyst
- Counterintelligence Analyst
- Technical Security Analyst

In these internships I was treated as a full-time employee and expected to perform as such. Applications and Services that I developed during these internships are still used today.
