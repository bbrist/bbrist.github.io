I was tasked with supporting a series of cloud-based mircoservices to process mission elements in realtime. During this time I've personally developed custom configurable frameworks to support new missions and limit the cost and time of development.
Additionally, I've spent time working to modernize the existing tech stack with the inclusion of Docker and Kafka, and provide insight via operational metrics using Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch.
